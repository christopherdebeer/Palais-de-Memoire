Consider referencing docs or prototype implementation as needed, but keep in mind that they are/were precursors not necessarily correct.
Make sure to keep main README.md up to date as you make changes.
Commit (and push to branch) progress in small incremental chunks not in one large commit.
We have setup a typechecking and transpilation to typescript but the majority of files are still vanilla js, convert to typescript when making changes.
Favour simplicity and encapsulation over complexity.
